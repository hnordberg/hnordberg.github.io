Let me explain.</div><div class="card-subtitle pt-4">Embeddings and understanding</div><div class="card-text">The weights of an LLM can be seen as representing concepts. They are embeddings into a multi-dimensional space.

This seems to indicate that there is a space of concepts that we can index into. Calling this <i>understand</i> may be a bit premature, but let&#x27;s continue.</div><div class="card-subtitle pt-4">Platonic representation</div><div class="card-text">You might wonder if the embeddings of one model are the same as another. No, they&#x27;re probably not. But there does seem to be a relationship still.

Google Gemini said it&#x27;s &quot;Thinking is the mental process of manipulating information to form concepts, solve problems, make decisions, and understand the world.&quot;; Grok said: &quot;cognitive process of using one&#x27;s mind to consider, reason about, or manipulate ideas...&quot;; Others give similar definitions, but they seem a tad circular to me. &quot;mental process of manipulating ideas&quot; and &quot;using one&#x27;s mind to consider&quot; are about the same to me, but don&#x27;t get to the underlying mechanism. I like the idea of a <i>train of thought</i> better. Thinking is generating words in your mind, based on the words you thought last. The thing is, there are multiple ways of thinking. The definition I just gave applies to when we are chatting with someone, or writing something like this paragraph. If someone asks us to do arithmetic, then we may be using a different part of the brain and the definition of thinking changes somewhat. But generating words (or concepts) based on previous words, is what LLMs do, so are they thinking? Yes, according to our definition, they are. But that doesn&#x27;t mean they are conscious.</div><div class="card-subtitle pt-4">Are we there yet?</div><div class="card-text">If defining thinking is hard, defining consciousness is even harder. That said, LLMs are not conscious in the way we are, yet. They would need to have a continuous, though not infinite, context. They would need to selectively forget things, and be able to update their weights as they generate new information. But maybe we are more machine-like than we thought.</div></div><div class="card" id="debugging"><div class="card-title">The Art of Debugging</div><div class="card-text">Debugging is a skill you hone over the years. With time you will start to recognize problems and their solutions. But there are some principles that you can keep in mind, especially when you get stuck on a difficult bug.<ul class="list"><li>Verify your assumptions</li><li>Verify your inputs</li><li>Break down the problem</li><li>Keep track of your progress</li><li>Explain the problem to someone</li><li>Don&#x27;t give up</li></ul>You may assume a function returns a certain kind of value -- verify that it does.<br/>You may assume the input is always in a certain range or of a certain type -- verify that it is.<br/>You may assume a library or class does what it says on the tin -- verify that it does.<br/>For really tricky bugs it&#x27;s helpful to write down the assumptions, the inputs, other system state, and to write down a plan of attack.</div></div><div class="card" id="test-automation"><div class="card-title">Test Automation</div><div class="card-text">When done right, test automation can save you a lot of time. Test automation is a big topic, and here I&#x27;ll just cover some observations and tips that I found useful.<ul class="list"><li>Write the tests early in the development process. That way you make use of the investment longer.</li><li>Run the tests on a schedule.</li><li>Review the test results frequently. Ideally you set alerts for when tests fail.</li><li>Make the test results part of your metrics.</li></ul></div><div class="card-subtitle pt-4">What tools to use?</div><div class="card-text">It depends on what the system under test is. For a web application, I would highly recommend Microsoft Playwright. It supports difficult use cases such as iframes and shadow DOM. At Optum we built a system where the user would launch tests from ALM (formerly HP ALM, now managed by Opentext) by clicking a toolbar button. We hooked up a script to the button that would invoke GitHub Actions workflow to run the Playwright tests. Playwright lets you take screenshots and record videos of the test runs. If a test failed, we would create a defect in ALM and attach screenshots and videos to it. We also emailed them to the user. These tests were for the Epic EMR (which now has a web version).</div></div><div class="card" id="security"><div class="card-title">Software Security</div><div class="card-title-subtitle">Delve deeper with the <a href="/p/security">Dig deeper into Security</a></div><div class="card-text">This section is about the steps you need to take as a software engineer to ensure that the products you make are secure. If your team is just starting to implement secure coding practices, then this is what you should do.<ul class="list"><li>Scan your code for secrets</li><li>Scan your dependencies for vulnerabilities</li><li>Scan your code for vulnerabilities</li></ul>If you use a platform like GitHub, then you will have all three available right away. Scanning your code for vulnerabilities might have an extra cost. When you are starting out, you may have a lot of vulnerabilities to triage. Use the CVSS score to prioritize them. Then establish a policy for handling them. It may look like this in terms of CVSS scores:<ul class="list"><li>≥ 9 is a critical; fix immediately / best effort</li><li>7 - 8.9 is a high; fix within 7 days</li><li>4 - 6.9 is a medium</li><li>≤ 3.9 is a low</li></ul>You can address medium and low vulnerabilities when you are fixing high and critical vulnerabilities. This is an example of a policy, and depending on your exposure, you may need to adjust it.</div><div class="card-subtitle pt-4">Avoid writing insecure code in the first place</div><div class="card-text">Make sure your team is familiar with the <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/">OWASP Top 10</a>, which is a list of the most common security vulnerabilities affecting web applications. Incorporate security review into your PR process. Make it an opportunity to learn and improve.</div><div class="card-subtitle pt-4">Scan your code for secrets</div><div class="card-text">The reason I put this first is that the impact of failing this is high. You or your developers may have committed proof of concept code with secrets in it. Or you may even have config files with secrets in them, directly in the repository. If you find secrets, you should invalidate them. If you have config files in your repo, you should switch to, ideally, using a vault. You can also use environment variables to store secrets, but this is not as secure.</div><div class="card-subtitle pt-4">Scan your dependencies for vulnerabilities</div><div class="card-text">SCA -- Software Composition Analysis -- is the process of analyzing the dependencies of your code. It will use your package manager to list the dependencies and then scan them for vulnerabilities. It then continues to for vulnerabilities recursively. For example, if you use <div class="code">npm</div> SCA will use <div class="code">package.json</div> and <div class="code">package-lock.json</div>to list the dependencies.<div class="block-quote">By the way, you should commit the <div class="code">package-lock.json</div> file to your repository. You should also use specific versions of the dependencies, not just ranges.</div>To fix the vulnerability, run <div class="code">npm ls &lt;package-name&gt;</div> to see where in the tree the package is used. If it is a direct dependency, you can just update the version but if it is a transitive dependency, you may need to add an entry in the <div class="code">overrides</div> section of the <div class="code">package.json</div> file.</div><div class="card-subtitle pt-4">Scan your code for vulnerabilities</div><div class="card-text">SAST -- Static Application Security Testing -- is the process of analyzing your code for vulnerabilities the authors of the code added. If you use a platform like GitHub, then you will have this available right away. Scanning your code for vulnerabilities might have an extra cost. This is straightforward to handle. Your scanner will explain the vulnerability and how to fix it.</div></div><div class="card" id="software-development-lifecycle"><div class="card-title">Software Development Lifecycle</div><div class="card-text">Here is a typical software development lifecycle:<ol><li>What task to work on<ol><li>Projects</li><li>Maintenance<ol><li>Security fix</li><li>Bug fix</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Source Control<ol><li>Create a new branch in the repo</li><li>Add Branch: &lt;branch&gt; to the card on the board you are working on</li><li>Branch names should be snakecase (e.g., my-branch).</li></ol></li><li>Write code<ol><li>Write the feature / fix the bug</li><li>Add unit tests if new feature</li><li>Add test automation that covers the new feature or that would have caught the bug</li><li>If you need to add libraries:<ol><li>Discuss with the senior developers</li><li>Commit your code to a branch and check SCA and SAST for vulnerabilities</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Use of AI agents for coding is encouraged.
