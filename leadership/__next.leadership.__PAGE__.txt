The main idea is to pick something that is important to the team / organization, and designate it as the focus. Each time someone finishes a task, they ask what they can do to further the focus of the week. It's a way of ensuring that important things get done first. Team members who finish tasks ask other team members -- that are working on FotW -- what they can do to help.

The team commits to finishing the focus by the end of the week. In a healthy organization the team will choose a focus that is challenging and without sandbagging (making it too easy). Use the retro to discuss how you can get better at picking the focus. The book suggests to have a separate meeting to celebrate the week's achievements. What we did instead is to use part of the Friday huddle to celebrate what was done and consider what was missed."}]]}]
