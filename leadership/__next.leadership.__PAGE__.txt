A conference is a good place to learn about new ideas and discuss what's working and what's not.

The main idea is to pick something that is important to the team / organization, and designate it as the focus. Each time someone finishes a task, they ask what they can do to further the focus of the week. It's a way of ensuring that important things get done first. Team members who finish tasks ask other team members -- that are working on FotW -- what they can do to help. It's simple and effective."]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"card-subtitle pt-4","children":"Focus planning and review"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"card-text","children":"Each Friday the team plans the focus for the following week. On Monday morning, the team reviews the focus for the week and adjusts it as needed. If you have multiple teams working on related efforts, you can have each team briefly present their focus. The team commits to finishing the focus by the end of the week. In a healthy organization the team will choose a focus that is challenging and without sandbagging (making it too easy). Use the retro to discuss how you can get better at picking the focus. The book suggests to have a separate meeting to celebrate the week's achievements. What we did instead is to use part of the Friday huddle to celebrate what was done and consider what was missed."}]]}]
