I like the idea of a ","$L3"," better. Thinking is generating words in your mind, based on the words you thought last. The thing is, there are multiple ways of thinking. The definition I just gave applies to when we are chatting with someone, or writing something like this paragraph. If someone asks us to do arithmetic, then we may be using a different part of the brain and the definition of thinking changes somewhat. But generating words (or concepts) based on previous words, is what LLMs do, so are they thinking? Yes, according to our definition, they are.

We hooked up a script to the button that would invoke GitHub Actions workflow to run the Playwright tests. Playwright lets you take screenshots and record videos of the test runs.
