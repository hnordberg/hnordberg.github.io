The queries were logical joins of ranges on several columns. A key feature of this work is the ability to perform query execution directly without needing to decompress the index first. One idea was to run clustering on the data, and re-order the events based on clusters.

The size doubles if all were real numbers. The vertical partitions are stored on disk. Now the bit-sliced index is designed to be a concise representation of these partitions, so that it is much smaller and can be stored in memory. Since the properties we deal with are numeric, we can partition each dimension into bins. For example, we can partition the \"energy\" dimension into 1–2 GeV, 2–3 GeV, and so on.

Instead, it represents them as-is. A single bit in each word indicates whether it is a count or a pattern. Results show a compression factor of 10-100. The choice of bins and bin boundaries has a significant impact on compression. Assume 100 properties, each with 10 bins. This requires 10¹¹ bits before compression. With a compression factor of 100, the space required is 10⁹ bits, or about 125 MBs. This can be stored permanently in memory. Note that it is not necessary to keep all bit slices in memory.

In that mode, each query is executed in a way that the transaction succeeds only after both database servers have confirmed a successful commit.
