The book is about OKRs and they discuss &quot;Monday Commitments and Friday Wins&quot; and we adapted it as Focus of the Week (FotW). The main idea is to pick something that is important to the team / organization, and designate it as the focus. Each time someone finishes a task, they ask what they can do to further the focus of the week. It&#x27;s a way of ensuring that important things get done first. Team members who finish tasks ask other team members -- that are working on FotW -- what they can do to help. It&#x27;s simple and effective.</div><div class="card-subtitle pt-4">Focus planning and review</div><div class="card-text">Each Friday the team plans the focus for the following week. On Monday morning, the team reviews the focus for the week and adjusts it as needed. If you have multiple teams working on related efforts, you can have each team briefly present their focus. The team commits to finishing the focus by the end of the week. In a healthy organization the team will choose a focus that is challenging and without sandbagging (making it too easy). Use the retro to discuss how you can get better at picking the focus. The book suggests to have a separate meeting to celebrate the week&#x27;s achievements. What we did instead is to use part of the Friday huddle to celebrate what was done and consider what was missed.</div></div><div class="card" id="lean-coffee"><div class="card-title">Lean Coffee -- Large meetings</div><div class="card-text">Lean Coffee is a way of gathering input from a large group of people. It&#x27;s useful when you likely will not have time to cover every topic. It&#x27;s driven by the participants, rather than the leader. If you have a large group, you can run your retros as a Lean Coffee meeting. I first learned about it from the fine folks at <a href="https://modernagile.org/">Modern Agile</a>.</div><div class="card-subtitle pt-4">Voting system</div><div class="card-text">It uses a voting system to decide what gets covered and in what order. In the original form, we would put a sticky note on the wall for each topic. Then we would vote on the topics. You get 3 votes (more if you have more participants). Put a dot on the sticky you would like to cover. In a remote setting, you can create a simple Kanban board and vote by putting your name on the card.

A core idea is that all ideas flow from the navigator to the driver, and that the driver only enters those ideas. You do, of course, swap roles so both can navigate. Mob programming is a variant of pairing but with more roles. In addition to the driver and navigator, there are also a few other roles: Facilitator (ensures courteousness and flow), Researcher, and others. I went to visit Hunter Industries in San Diego to learn about their approach to pairing and mob programming. I observed multiple groups there. Everyone at the company seemed to like it.</div><div class="card-subtitle pt-4">Benefits</div><div class="card-text">The main benefit is having more eyes on the code.

But not all developers are extroverts and enjoy the process. If you want to introduce it, you should stick with it for a meaningful length of time, at least for a couple of months.
