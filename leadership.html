Lean is metrics driven and the focus is on tasks that can be completed in one to two days. Scrum usually have tasks spanning multiple days and releases every two weeks. Completing a task generally means getting it into production. This means you must have both a release pipeline and test automation that&#x27;re strong enough to be relied on for such frequent releases.</div><div class="card-subtitle pt-4">Should you switch from Scrum to Lean?</div><div class="card-text">In the end both methods work. I have observed happier teams when they are using Lean, and I would say it is worth exploring. It may seem daunting at first, but teams generally adapt quickly to it. If you are curious, seek out an Agile conference to attend. That&#x27;s how I learned about Lean (Agile-CA). A conference is a good place to learn about new ideas and discuss what&#x27;s working and what&#x27;s not. Bring someone from your team and you&#x27;ll likely have a champion when it comes to implementing it.</div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-title">Retrospectives</div><div class="card-text">A retro is a meeting where the team reflects on what went well and what could be improved.

The book is about OKR&#x27;s but they discuss &quot;Monday Commitments and Friday Wins&quot; and we adapted it as Focus of the Week (FotW). The main idea is to pick something that is important to the team / organization, and designate it as the focus. Each time someone finishes a task, they ask what they can do to further the focus of the week. It&#x27;s a way of ensuring that important things get done first. Team members who finish tasks ask other team members -- that are working on FotW -- what they can do to help. It&#x27;s simple and effective.</div><div class="card-subtitle pt-4">Focus planning and review</div><div class="card-text">Each Friday the team plans the focus for the following week. On Monday morning, the team reviews the focus for the week and adjusts it as needed. If you have multiple teams working on related efforts, you can have each team briefly present their focus. The team commits to finishing the focus by the end of the week. In a healthy organization the team will choose a focus that is challenging and without sandbagging (making it too easy). Use the retro to discuss how you can get better at picking the focus. The book suggests to have a separate meeting to celebrate the week&#x27;s achievements. What we did instead is to use part of the Friday huddle to celebrate what was done and consider what was missed.</div></div><div class="card hidden"><div class="card-title">.</div><div class="card-text">.</div><div class="card-subtitle pt-4">.</div></div></section></main><!--$--><!--/$--><footer><p>© <!-- -->2025<!-- --> Henrik Nordberg</p></footer><script src="/_next/static/chunks/7948aa0b650af5c0.js" id="_R_" async=""></script><script>(self.__next_f=self.__next_f||[]).push([0])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1:\"$Sreact.fragment\"\n2:I[58195,[\"/_next/static/chunks/a5494b77204598c0.js\"],\"default\"]\n3:I[62863,[\"/_next/static/chunks/a5494b77204598c0.js\"],\"default\"]\n4:I[39756,[\"/_next/static/chunks/ff1a16fafef87110.js\",\"/_next/static/chunks/247eb132b7f7b574.js\"],\"default\"]\n5:I[37457,[\"/_next/static/chunks/ff1a16fafef87110.js\",\"/_next/static/chunks/247eb132b7f7b574.js\"],\"default\"]\nc:I[68027,[\"/_next/static/chunks/ff1a16fafef87110.js\",\"/_next/static/chunks/247eb132b7f7b574.js\"],\"default\"]\n:HL[\"/_next/static/chunks/f664a6b56b9d07e2.css\",\"style\"]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"0:{\"P\":null,\"b\":\"4RvDHv9jKtr8DOT0sI7Dh\",\"c\":[\"\",\"leadership\"],\"q\":\"\",\"i\":false,\"f\":[[[\"\",{\"children\":[\"leadership\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{}]}]},\"$undefined\",\"$undefined\",true],[[\"$\",\"$1\",\"c\",{\"children\":[[[\"$\",\"link\",\"0\",{\"rel\":\"stylesheet\",\"href\":\"/_next/static/chunks/f664a6b56b9d07e2.css\",\"precedence\":\"next\",\"crossOrigin\":\"$undefined\",\"nonce\":\"$undefined\"}],[\"$\",\"script\",\"script-0\",{\"src\":\"/_next/static/chunks/a5494b77204598c0.js\",\"async\":true,\"nonce\":\"$undefined\"}]],[\"$\",\"html\",null,{\"lang\":\"en\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"body\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"header\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$L2\",null,{}],[\"$\",\"$L3\",null,{}]]}],[\"$\",\"$L4\",null,{\"parallelRouterKey\":\"children\",\"error\":\"$undefined\",\"errorStyles\":\"$undefined\",\"errorScripts\":\"$undefined\",\"template\":[\"$\",\"$L5\",null,{}],\"templateStyles\":\"$undefined\",\"templateScripts\":\"$undefined\",\"notFound\":[[[\"$\",\"title\",null,{\"children\":\"404: This page could not be found.\"}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"style\":{\"fontFamily\":\"system-ui,\\\"Segoe UI\\\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\\\"Apple Color Emoji\\\",\\\"Segoe UI Emoji\\\"\",\"height\":\"100vh\",\"textAlign\":\"center\",\"display\":\"flex\",\"flexDirection\":\"column\",\"alignItems\":\"center\",\"justifyContent\":\"center\"},\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"style\",null,{\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}\"}}],[\"$\",\"h1\",null,{\"className\":\"next-error-h1\",\"style\":{\"display\":\"inline-block\",\"margin\":\"0 20px 0 0\",\"padding\":\"0 23px 0 0\",\"fontSize\":24,\"fontWeight\":500,\"verticalAlign\":\"top\",\"lineHeight\":\"49px\"},\"children\":404}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"style\":{\"display\":\"inline-block\"},\"children\":[\"$\",\"h2\",null,{\"style\":{\"fontSize\":14,\"fontWeight\":400,\"lineHeight\":\"49px\",\"margin\":0},\"children\":\"This page could not be found.\"}]}]]}]}]],[]],\"forbidden\":\"$undefined\",\"unauthorized\":\"$undefined\"}],[\"$\",\"footer\",null,{\"children\":[\"$\",\"p\",null,{\"children\":[\"© \",2025,\" Henrik Nordberg\"]}]}]]}]}]]}],{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$1\",\"c\",{\"children\":[null,[\"$\",\"$L4\",null,{\"parallelRouterKey\":\"children\",\"error\":\"$undefined\",\"errorStyles\":\"$undefined\",\"errorScripts\":\"$undefined\",\"template\":[\"$\",\"$L5\",null,{}],\"templateStyles\":\"$undefined\",\"templateScripts\":\"$undefined\",\"notFound\":\"$undefined\",\"forbidden\":\"$undefined\",\"unauthorized\":\"$undefined\"}]]}],{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$1\",\"c\",{\"children\":[[\"$\",\"main\",null,{\"children\":[\"$\",\"section\",null,{\"className\":\"card-grid\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"card\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"card-title\",\"children\":\"Metrics, OKRs, and reviewing progress\"}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"card-text\",\"children\":\"Much has been written about metrics, so I will focus on the core of the idea -- creating a loop of deciding what metrics to use, recording them, and reviewing them regularly.
